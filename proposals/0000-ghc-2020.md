# Language versions

This proposal sets up a process to introduce new language versions `GHC20XX`, extending `Haskell2010` as defined by the Report with several extensions.

## Motivation

It has almost become a meme that any slightly-complex Haskell module starts with a dozen lines of `{-# LANGUAGE #-}` pragmas. This poses several problems:

- beginners often see features behind an extension as "advanced" or "obscure", even though some like `LambdaCase` or `NamedFieldPuns` are quite simple;
- some sorts of programming in Haskell -- mostly type-level oriented -- require enables lots of extensions (think of the usual combo `MultiParamTypeClasses` + `FlexibleInstances` + `FlexibleContexts`). Sometimes the fact that there are different extensions, instead of a single `ExtendedTypeClasses` is mostly historical.

For that reason, it's benefitial to pack those extensions which have "graduated" in terms of stability and usefulness into a single language version.

The second goal is to involve the community in the process. The previous reports, Haskell 98 and Haskell 2010, where designed by a Committee; but that was before the GHC Proposals process had taken shape.

## Proposed Change Specification

We propose to introduce a process to develop new "language versions", dubbed `GHC20XX`, which extend `Haskell2010` with some default extensions. This proposal does not set _which_ extensions are included, rather seeks to provide a framework to reach a conclusion in a timely manner.

### Criteria

We define a set of six criteria. Not all criteria _must_ be satisfied for an extension to be included, but there should be a stronger reason in that case.

1. The extension is (mostly) _conservative_: All programs that were accepted without the extension remain accepted, and with the same meaning. We prefer to take this as a strict criteria, and grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis.
2. _New failure modes_ that become possible with the extension are _rare_ and/or easy to diagnose. These failure modes include new error messages, wrong inferred types, and runtime errors, for example. In other words, the _developer experience_ should not get worse by adding this extension to the default mix.
3. The extensions _complement_ the design of standard Haskell. This is the most subjective of the criteria. For example, `MultiParamTypeClasses` extends what's already there, and works well with the rest of features. If we suddenly decided you can use Lisp-like syntax, that would not complement the current design.
4. The extension has been -- and can reasonably be predicted to remain -- _stable_.
5. The extension is _not_ to _gate-keep_ an advanced or potentially-unsafe feature. `IncoherentInstances` should not be enabled by default because of its potential unsafety.
6. The extension has _widespread_ usage.

### Process

Upon acceptance of this proposal, a new repository `ghc-proposals/ghc-language` should be started.

Discussion about each extension should happen in a separate _issue_, in which the proponent should argument their reason for inclusion. We follow the same procedure as in GHC proposals: after enough time to gather feedback from the community, the GHC Steering Committee makes a final veredict about the inclusion. However, when a proposal is rejected, a new issue can be opened in the _following_ cycle, if anybody feels that the extension is now ready for inclusion.

Every year the chosen set of extensions is packed as `GHC20XX` into the corresponding GHC version being released that year around spring. The deadline is strict, extensions in discussion need to wait for the next release cycle. The GHC Steering Committee shall appoint one of its members to make the required changes to both GHC and Cabal.

## Examples


## Effect and Interactions


## Costs and Drawbacks


## Alternatives

- Having a longer cycle than yearly, maybe every two/three years?

## Unresolved Questions

- What is the relation (if any) between this new language versions and Haskell Prime?

## Implementation Plan

(Optional) If accepted who will implement the change? Which other resources
and prerequisites are required for implementation?

## Endorsements

(Optional) This section provides an opportunty for any third parties to express their
support for the proposal, and to say why they would like to see it adopted.
It is not mandatory for have any endorsements at all, but the more substantial
the proposal is, the more desirable it is to offer evidence that there is
significant demand from the community.  This section is one way to provide
such evidence.
